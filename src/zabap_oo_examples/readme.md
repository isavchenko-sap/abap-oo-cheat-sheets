# ABAP Object-Oriented Examples

This folder contains practical examples of **Object-Oriented Programming in ABAP**, designed to help developers understand and apply ABAP OO concepts in real projects.

The examples are sourced from the official [SAP-samples/abap-oo-basics](https://github.com/SAP-samples/abap-oo-basics) repository and organized to provide hands-on learning for developers at all levels.

## ðŸ“˜ What's Included

| Example Class | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `zcl_oo_basics` | Basic class structure and attributes/methods. |
| `zcl_oo_constructor` | Example of constructor methods and object instantiation. |
| `zcl_oo_inheritance` | Demonstrates class inheritance and method overriding. |
| `zcl_oo_polymorphism` | Shows dynamic method binding and polymorphism. |
| `zcl_oo_interfaces` | Implementation of interfaces and multiple inheritance. |

1. Import the classes into your SAP system using **ABAPGit** or manually copy them into your package.
2. Open the relevant class (`SE24`) and explore the code structure.
3. Experiment by extending or modifying the examples to reinforce your understanding.
4. Use the examples as templates in your own ABAP development.
